Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

We created a business design document analyzing the proposed system for the client driverpass. Driverpass would like to build a web based system to provide practice tests and schedule driving lessons to aide their customers in passing the driver license exams.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I covered the functional and non-functional requirements requested by the client well in this document and provided clear visuals of aspects in the diagrams provided in the documents.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 
If I were to revise one aspect of the project it would be in the presentation and I would add opening and closing remarks to better prepare for presenting to a client.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Based off the initial interview I interpreted that the system needed to be web based to allow access from any browser connected to the internet. It's important to consider the user needs when designing a system as they will be the ones using it and it needs to be efficient and effective for them otherwise they will not use it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In designing a system it is important to use the system development life cycle to plan and analyze a system or proposed system to fully understand the needs of the system. once this is complete we can begin the design stage of the life cycle and implement them into the system. After this the maintenence stage begins which is really just starting the whole process over to continue the cycle. Future techniques that I've learned that will be helpful are the creation of various diagrams like the class, activity, use case, and sequence diagram which all help to provide a good understanding of the system.
